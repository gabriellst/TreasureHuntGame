# The Treasure Hunt!

Hey everyone, my first semester's final project consisted of creating a game similar to minefield games.

All Treasure Hunt's captions are in portuguese.

### Here's what my team got up with.

## Game Experience

### Treasure Hunt is a 1v1 turn based minefield-like game.

You and your opponent are supposed to find as many treasure chests as possible, each one of them increase your score by 100 points, but beware of the kraken chests, they reduce your score by 50 points!

### Numbers revealed when a cell is clicked indicate how many **treasure** chests are around that cell in a *+* direction, use that information to guide your playthrough.

### At the end, when all cells are revealed, the player with the highest score wins!
